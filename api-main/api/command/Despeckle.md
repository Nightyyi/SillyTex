# Despeckle

```lua
app.command.Despeckle {
  ui=bool,
  channels=FilterChannels...,
  width=int,
  height=int,
  tiledMode=string,
}
```

* `ui`: Show the dialog on the screen, `true` by default.
* `channels`: A combination of [FilterChannels](../filterchannels.md#filterchannels) with
  [bitwise OR (`|`) operator](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#3.4.2).
  By default it is equal to:
  [FilterChannels.RED](../filterchannels.md#filterchannelsred) |
  [FilterChannels.GREEN](../filterchannels.md#filterchannelsgreen) |
  [FilterChannels.BLUE](../filterchannels.md#filterchannelsblue) |
  [FilterChannels.GRAY](../filterchannels.md#filterchannelsgray).
* `width`: Width of the convolution matrix to calculate the median. `3` by default.
* `height`: Height of the convolution matrix to calculate the median. `3` by default.
* `tiledMode`: `"none"`, `"x"`, `"y"`, `"both"`. By default it's
  `"none"` if there is no UI, or it's equal to `app.preferences.document(app.sprite).tiled.mode`
  when `ui` is `true`.
