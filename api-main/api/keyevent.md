macOS) was pressed when the event occurs.

## KeyEvent.ctrlKey

True if the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key was pressed when the event occurs.

## KeyEvent.shiftKey

True if the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key was pressed when the event occurs.

## KeyEvent.spaceKey

True if the <kbd>Space</kbd> key was pressed when the event occurs.

want to avoid triggering a command with a keyboard shortcut.
